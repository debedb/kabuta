# Kabuta

Kabuta adapts [Delve's API](https://github.com/derekparker/delve/tree/master/Documentation/api) to [GDB/MI interface](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gdb-5.1.1/html_node/gdb_211.html#SEC216) for the purpose of making Delve available to various frontends (IDE, GUI debugger interfaces, etc.) that already have integration with GDB.

Specifically this is oriented to the my use of [Goclipse](https://goclipse.github.io/).
